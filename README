A simple script to use a SpacePilot Pro Mouse as a game input device by simply rerouting button and axis inputs to a uinput device. It should work with other Space Navigator compatible mice with minimal modifications. 

Tested with Python 3.8.1 and on the Linux version of Kerbal Space Program.

# Installing

Install spnav with pip. Comment the two lines that crash in its __init__ file if it fails to load with an undefined symbol.

Install uinput with pip, and load the kernel module modprobe uinput

Start the spacenavd service.

Execute the bridge: python bind.py

For KSP, the bridge must be started before the game, else it doesn't detect the game device
